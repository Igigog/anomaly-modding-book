# Defaults
This scroll stores the default values for the plugins. A general description is given on this page. Some scrolls can store two types of parameters: Import for importing and Export for exporting. When you call import/export operators, their settings will always be set to the values specified in this Defaults section of the settings. The settings from the previous operator call are not saved in subsequent calls.
