## About

The A-Life (Artificial Life) system in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is a technology developed by GSC Game World that simulates the life of the game world as an independent ecosystem. It creates the feeling of a living, dynamic world where characters, mutants and other entities exist independently of the player and interact with each other according to their own rules.

## Main features of the A-Life system

### NPC autonomy

- Characters in the game (stalkers, bandits, military, mutants, etc.) have their own goals, routines and routes. They can hunt, patrol the territory, rest, trade or conflict with each other.

- For example, stalkers can explore the Zone on their own, collect artifacts, fight mutants or other groups.

### World dynamics

- The world of the Zone lives its own life, even if the player is not around. Events take place without the player's participation: groups of stalkers may encounter mutants, bandits attack civilians, and the military conduct mop-up operations. This creates the feeling that the player is just a part of the big world, not its center.

### Mutant ecosystem

- Mutants are also subject to the A-Life system. They hunt, patrol their territories, and attack stalkers or other mutants. For example, a pack of pseudo-dogs can chase a stalker, and a bloodsucker can ambush a stalker.

### Global and local events

- The A-Life system manages both local events (e.g. a firefight between two groups) and global events (factions taking over territories, changing the balance of power in the Zone).

### Reaction to player actions

- The player can influence the world, but the A-Life system adapts to the player's actions. For example, if the player destroys a bandit camp, other factions may try to take over the area.

- A player's reputation and actions affect how other characters treat him.

### Technical implementation

- The A-Life system works on the basis of complex algorithms that control the behavior of hundreds of objects simultaneously. Even when the player is not in a particular location, the system continues to simulate events in the background.
