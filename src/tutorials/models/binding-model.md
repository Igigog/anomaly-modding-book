## About

So you want to make a new model of weapons, stalker or mutant and replace, or add to the existing ones.

Example on the stalker model.

### Import

Import any stalker model.

### Binding

Bind model to skeleton.

Your model must be in the same pose as the imported model (have the same height and proportions) (For stalkers the binding pose is T-pose), but in theory you can not put your model in the right pose, but then there may be problems with animations (the animation itself will be played correctly, but the geometry attached to the bones may move incorrectly).

### Checking

You can import an animation or just move the character's bones to check the binding.

### Export

Export model
