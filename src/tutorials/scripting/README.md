# Scripting

___

Hey, you. You're finally awake! You were trying to cross the border, right?

So, well, scripting.

Writing scripts for this game is hard, really. You will want to start with  [Lua book](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) to learn the basics of Lua programming language. I don't know how good it is at teaching general programming concepts, but you surely are brave enough to not concede before a mere programming skill? Right?)

Anyway, the whole programming thing is kinda hard, so feel free to ask questions in [Anomaly Discord](https://discord.gg/c4RuJNs). Channel *#modding-coding* is just for you.

Starting here I will assume you know lua. You read the book from start to end and became a master of this programming language. Or at least you know the difference between `if` and `while`.

Oh, by the way, code editor. I like [Codium](https://vscodium.com/), but I know RavenAscendant uses [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) like some old man. For the first couple of scripts you'll be fine with either, choose for yourself.
