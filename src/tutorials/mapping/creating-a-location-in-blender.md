# Creating a location in Blender

___

## Need to know

- How working in Blender
- Familiarize yourself with the formats for levels (.lights, level, .ai, .cform, .details, .env_mod, .fog_vol, .game, .geom, .geomx, [.hom](../main-folders-and-files/file-formats/index.html#hom-hierarchical-occlusion-mapping), .ltx, .ps_static, .spawn, .wallmarks, .som ([List here](../main-folders-and-files/file-formats/index.html)))

## Beginning

Choose and download the SDK (A list of SDKs can be found [here](../modding-tools/modding-tools.md))

At the moment in the addon for Blender it is not possible to create a full-fledged location (no compiler, creating ai-nodes, etc.), so you need to use it with the SDK.
