# Community Standards

## About

Anomaly Modding Book was decided that you will use these tools for modding and to avoid problems when modding the game so all the articles in this book are written under this standard.

### Engine

### Anomaly Modded Exes

Community-supported engine. All articles written about the engine will have the use of this engine.

- [Engine Overview](../engine/README.md)
- [GitHub Source](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith)

### SDK

#### IX-Ray SDK

IX-Ray is currently the most advanced project with engine and SDK support. So all the SDK articles described in this book imply the use of the IX-Ray SDK.

- [SDK Overview](../modding-tools/sdk/README.md)

### Code editor

You can use any one that supports Lua and XML files.

Also, you may need these extensions:

- [ltx support](../modding-tools/coding/ltx-support.md) - Extension which adds support for [logic syntax](../reference/file-formats/conf-script/ltx.md) from S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
- [Encodex](https://github.com/Tosox/Encodex) - Extension which automatically detects and switches the encoding of files across different formats
