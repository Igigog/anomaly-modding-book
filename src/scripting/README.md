# Scripting

----

Hey, you. You're finally awake! You were trying to cross the border, right?

So, well, scripting. 

Writing scripts for this game is hard, really. You will want to start with  [Lua book](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) to learn the basics of Lua programming language. I don't know how good it is at teaching general programming concepts, but you surely are brave enough to not concede before a mere programming skill? Right?)

Anyway, the whole programming thing is kinda hard, so feel free to ask questions in [Anomaly Discord](https://discord.gg/c4RuJNs). Channel *#modding-coding* is just for you.

Starting here I will assume you know lua. You read the book from start to end and became a master of this programming language. Or at least you know the difference between `if` and `while`.

Oh, by the way, code editor. I like [Codium](https://vscodium.com/), but I know RavenAscendant uses [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) like some old man. For the first couple of scripts you'll be fine with either, choose for yourself.
