# Introduction

___

Oh hey there! Nice to see you :)

This place will introduce you to the concepts of modding Anomaly, from installing your first mod to creating your own game-changing addons.

Choose a chapter from our table of contents and start reading. I recommend starting with:

- [Mod Organizer guide](tutorials/getting-started/installing-mo2.md).

If you want to contribute - feel free to send your articles (markdown-formatted) per Discord or learn [ways to contribute](meta/contributing.md).

Good luck, have fun, don't die
