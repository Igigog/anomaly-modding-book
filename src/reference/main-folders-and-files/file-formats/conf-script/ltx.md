## About

LTX files are basically ini files with some custom additions. They are located all over the `gamedata/configs` and are used for, well, configs.

~~~admonish example title='Here it is how ltx config might look like:'
```ini,lang=LTX
#include "tables/gun_*.ltx"

[some_nice_gun]
recoil              = 0.8
boosts              = a, b, c, d    ; list
fancy_feature       = {=is_night()} true, false

[some_other_gun]
...
```
~~~

From this example we can see some fancy ltx features:

1. `#include` preprocessor command. This command basically merges the file into this config. Many of the configs are included into `system.ltx` this way, so you can access almost all sections through `ini_sys` handler.
2. Wildcard imports - `*` in include statement corresponds to any text, so the given include will include both `gun_ak.ltx` and `gun_m4.ltx`. This feature was developed for Anomaly, so you may not find it in other mods.
3. Name of the section in square brackets - this is referred in scripts as `section_name` or just `section`.
4. Key-value pairs. Values may include comma-separated lists.
5. Comments start with `;`.
6. `fancy_feature` uses something called "condlist". Refer to [condlists manual](../../configs/condlists.md) to understand this bs.
