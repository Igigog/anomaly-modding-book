| 0x1 | [number of edges](#block-0x1-edges) * 24 + 4 | edges |
| 0x2 | [number of triangles](#block-0x2-triangles) * 36 + 4 | triangles |

### Blocks

All vertices in the file are stored in the following structure:

| Type | Description |

| f | 3D coordinate Y |
| f | 3D coordinate Z |

#### Block 0x0 (vertices)

Contains vertices that were glued during compilation.

Block structure:

| Type | Description |
---|---|
| I | number of vertices |
|  | vertices |

#### Block 0x1 (edges)
