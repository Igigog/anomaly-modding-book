## About

The bump map is a regular normal map in A(BGR) format (typical for DXT5_nm compression format). The developers used this order for a very simple reason - DXT compression "spoils" the texture much less, since the alpha channel is not subjected to compression and remains almost in its original form.

## Technical information

### Format

- R - Glossiness (Glossiness, aka inverted roughness. It works best in stalker, and allows for using better [BRDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function))
- G - Normal Z (Unused)
- B - Normal Y (DirectX format)
- A - Normal X
