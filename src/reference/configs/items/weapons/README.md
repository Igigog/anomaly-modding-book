# Weapon Configs

___

## About

Here you will find all the parameters you need to fine tune your weaponry.

Parameters of the weapon are set for each sample in a separate [*.ltx](../../../file-formats/conf-script/ltx.md) file, and consist of two sections (Each contains its own set of parameters):

- \[wpn_name] - Main, it sets most of the parameters (for NPC and 3rd-person view).

- \[wpn_name_hud] - Secondary, where you set first-person view parameters only.
