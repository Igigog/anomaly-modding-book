# HOM (Hierarchical Occlusion Mapping)

___

## About

This is a technique used in computer graphics to efficiently control the rendering of scene objects, especially in 3D applications. It builds a hierarchical structure to determine which objects or parts of the scene can be hidden from the camera by other objects, thus reducing the amount of computation required for rendering. This improves performance by avoiding rendering invisible objects.
