## About

Sector is part of Portal Rendering.
An area or section of virtual space that contains objects and geometry for rendering. Sectors help organize the scene, allowing you to control visibility and performance, especially in large worlds. Each sector can contain its own lighting, texture, and object data, making it easier to process information during rendering.
