## About

The [THM Editor](thm-editor-by-i-love-kfc.md) from i-love-kfc was taken as the basis, finalized and fixed. Allows you to work with [.thm](../../main-folders-and-files/file-formats/index.html#thm) files.

## Features

- Supports 99% of thm parameters

## Functionality

### Hotkeys

- F4 - Open file
- F5, Ctrl+S - Save file
- F6 - Save as

### Buttons

- #### File Button

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| Load | Loads the selected .thm |
| Save | Save .thm |
| Save As | Save as .thm |

- #### Tools Button

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| Import DDS Params | Adjust .thm to the texture format (texture format can be set incorrectly, so sometimes it is worth adjusting it manually) |
| Generate THM for texture | When you select a basic texture, the program creates a thm with basic properties for it (if a texture with the prefix _bump is found, the thm will set all the necessary flags for using bumps) |

> All parameters same as in [THM Editor by i-love-kfc](thm-editor-by-i-love-kfc.md)
