# Create X-Ray Material Operator

___

## About

This operator allows you to quickly create shader nodes for a material. When you run the operator, it opens a file browser where you need to select an image file to be used in shader nodes. The path in the file browser is set the same as the [Textures Folder](../addon-preference-panels/blender-x-ray-addon-preference-panel-paths.md#textures-folder) parameter. The display mode of the files is set to thumbnails. After the operator is executed, three nodes will be created: `Diffuse BSDF`, `Material Output`, `Image Texture`
