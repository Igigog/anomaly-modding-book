# Create X-Ray Material Operator

___

## About

This operator allows you to quickly create shader nodes for a material. When you run the operator, it opens a file browser where you need to select an image file to be used in shader nodes. The path in the file browser is set the same as the Textures Folder parameter. The display mode of the files is set to thumbnails. After the operator is executed, three nodes will be created: Diffuse BSDF, Material Output, Image Texture.
