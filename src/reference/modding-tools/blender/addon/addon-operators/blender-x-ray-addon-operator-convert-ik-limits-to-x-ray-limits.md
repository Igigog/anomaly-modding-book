# Convert IK Limits to X-Ray Limits Operator

___

## About

Converts IK limit values from the standard Properties > Bone > Inverse Kinematics panel to the addon's X-Ray limits, which are located in the X-Ray Engine: Bone panel. The values of Limit X: Min/Max, Limit Y: Min/Max, Limit Z: Min/Max from the Inverse Kinematics panel are converted for the X-Ray coordinate system and fit into the Limit X: Min/Max, Limit Y: Min/Max, Limit Z: Min/Max parameters from the X-Ray Engine: Bone panel. The values are converted for all bones of the active object. This operator is used for obsolete blend files that are saved using an addon version earlier than v0.7.0. The operator is required to convert obsolete values. For more information about limits with IK and X-Ray types, see here: Use Limits.
