# XML files

XML files are used to save text strings used for translation. All XML files are located in `gamedata/configs/text/*lang*`. XML files have these properties:

1. They are saved in encoding Windows-1251. English translation won't break if you're using UTF, but russian will.
2. Every string must have an unique id assigned to it.
1. There is a single namespace for all xml files of one language. That means, no matter in which file you are saving your strings, they will be available in one place, namely `game.translate_string(*id*)`.

XML file will look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1251"?>
<string_table>
	<string id="nice_text_id">
		<text>Cool text inside text tags</text>
	</string>

    <string id="another_text_id">
		<text>...</text>
	</string>
    
    ...
</string_table>
```
