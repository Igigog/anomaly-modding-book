# X-Ray Engine: Bone

___

## About

This page describes the X-Ray Engine: Bone panel. Some parameters from this panel are displayed only for certain joint types (Joint Type parameter)

## Location

`Properties` window > `Bone` tab

## Parameters

### Exportable

If on, the bone will be exportable and will be saved when exporting to [*.object](../../../reference/file-formats/models/object.md) and [*.ogf](../../../reference/file-formats/models/ogf.md). If off, it will not be used during export. Usually this parameter should be turned off for additional rig bones, for example, for bones of inverse kinematics. This parameter should be turned on for deforming bones or for bones that must be in the skeleton.

### Material

Bone Shape Material

### Length

TODO

### Shape Type

Shape Type

- None - No Shape
- Box - Parallelepiped
- Cylinder - Cylinder
- Sphere - Sphere
- Custom - Customizable type which is specified using the identifier in the Shape ID parameter

### Shape ID

Identifier for Custom Shape

### No Pickable

Excludes a bone from collision handling

### No Physics

Excludes physics processing for bone

### Remove After Break

Allows removal of bone after an object has been destroyed

### No Fog Collider

Bone won't interact with a voluminous smoke

### Joint Type

- None - No joint
- Rigid - Rigid Joint
- Cloth - Cloth Joint

- Custom - Custom type which is specified using the identifier in the Joint ID parameter

### Joint ID

Identifier for Custom joint

### Breakable

Allows bone to be breakable

### Force

Threshold breaking force

### Torque

Threshold fracture torque

### Friction

Shape friction

### Spring

Shape spring

### Damping

Shape damping

### Limit X/Y/Z: Min/Max

Rotation limits for bones with type Joint. These are set using the minimum and maximum rotation angle.

### Limit X/Y/Z: Spring/Damping

Spring and damping for bones with Joint type.

### Slide Z: Spring/Damping

Spring and damping during sliding for Slider type bones.

### Rotate Z: Spring/Damping

Spring and damping during rotation for Slider type bones.

### Steer: Min/Max

Amplitude of rotation of the front wheels of the vehicle while turning the steering wheel. Set the minimum and maximum angle.

### Slide Z: Min/Max

Sliding limits for bones with Slider type. Specified by means of a minimum and maximum value, which is specified in meters.

### Rotate Z: Min/Max

Rotation limits for bones with Slider type. Specified using the minimum and maximum rotation angle.

### Mass

Bone shape mass value in kilograms.

### Center of Mass

Shape center of mass coordinate.

## Operators

### Edit Shape

Turns on the mode of shape editing. After launching the operator, a shape object will be added to the scene and can be transformed. In the Properties window in the Object tab of the X-Ray Engine: Edit Helper panel, operators for working with a shape will be displayed.

### Edit Center

Enables the center of mass editing mode. After you run the operator, a pacifier object will be added to the scene and can be moved. In the Properties window in the Object tab of the X-Ray Engine: Edit Helper panel, operators for working with the center of mass will be displayed
