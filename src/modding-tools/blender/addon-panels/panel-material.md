# X-Ray Engine: Material

___

## About

This panel stores material parameters (Surface in X-Ray SDK)

## Location

Properties window, Material tab of the mesh object

## General parameters

### Surface Presets

Material presets. Shader, Compile, Material, Two Sided parameters are stored in presets. Presets work in the same way as standard presets

### Shader

Engine Shader. If in the addon settings is specified shader.xr file in the Engine Shaders File parameter, then in the shader selection menu (located in the same line and has a down arrow icon) you can specify any shader from the file. It is also possible to specify an arbitrary value by typing it in the input field. If the object type is set to Dynamic or Progressive Dynamic, then when creating a material the shader value will be models\model. For all other types, the default value will be default

### Compile

Compiler Shader. The compiler shader selection menu works similarly to the engine shader, but the shader_xrlc.xr file is specified in the Compile Shaders File parameter

### Material

Game Material. The game material selection menu works similarly to the engine shader, but the gamemtl.xr file is specified in the Game Materials File parameter. If you move the mouse cursor over a material from the list, a tooltip will display a description of the material, which is specified in the gamemtl.xr file:

01

### Two Sided

Double-sided surface. If this parameter is enabled for a material, then when exporting to *.ogf, twice as many polygons that use this material will be saved, because the polygons will be saved for both sides. When exporting to \*.object the number of polygons will not change, because X-Ray SDK itself doubles the number of polygons when exporting to \*.ogf.
