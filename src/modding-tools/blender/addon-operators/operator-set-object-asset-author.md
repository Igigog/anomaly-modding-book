# Set Object Asset Author

___

## About

This operator sets the name of the asset creator for the selected objects. If the object is an asset, the `Author` parameter (located in the `Asset Browser` window in the `N`-panel) is changed in the Asset settings. The value of the `Owner Name` parameter will be used as the parameter value (`Properties` window, `Object` tab, `X-Ray Engine: Object` panel, `Revision` block). To make an object an Asset, you need to call the standard operator from the `Object` > `Asset` > `Mark as Asset` menu of the `3D Viewport` window
