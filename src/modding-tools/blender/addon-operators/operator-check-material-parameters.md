# Оператор Check Material Parameters

___

## About

This operator checks xray-parameters of materials: Engine Shader, Compile Shader, Game Material. Sometimes files from mods or builds have engine shaders, compile shaders and game materials that are not in SoC, CS or CoP, because of which the game or compilation will crash. When checking shaders and materials used [*.xr](../../../reference/file-formats/archives-resource-packs/xr.md) files that are specified in the addon settings (shaders.xr, shaders_xrlc.xr, gamemtl.xr). This operator looks for those problematic materials that have missing xray-parameters in the \*.xr files. After the operator runs, a log text file will be created with the following content:

```python
Incorrect Materials:

    Material: "Material":
        Compile Shader: "456"

    Material: "Material.001":
        Game Material: "789"

    Material: "Material.002":
        Engine Shader: "123"
```

## Modes
