## About

This panel contains the file viewer. It is necessary for quick viewing of files that contain 3D models. There is support for viewing [*.object](../../../reference/file-formats/models/object.md), [*.ogf](../../../reference/file-formats/models/ogf.md), [*.dm](../../../reference/file-formats/models/dm.md), [*.details](../../../reference/file-formats/game-levels/details.md). The viewer has a list of files. If you click on a file in the list, it will be imported. If you click on another file, it will be imported and data blocks from the previous file will be removed. When switching between files, previously imported objects, meshes, materials, textures, images, armatures, animations will be deleted. To prevent data blocks from the previous file from being deleted, you should import the file using the operators from the Import group. To scroll through the files in the list, you should put the mouse cursor over the list and press the up or down arrow keys.
