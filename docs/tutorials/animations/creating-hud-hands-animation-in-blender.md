## Beginning

* Download the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) and install it.
* Download any set of hands from [discord](https://discord.com/channels/456765861953536020/883097205710389288/1071072858358431804)
* Download the [X-Ray Tools for Blender](https://github.com/PavelBlend/blender-xray/releases)
* Install the X-Ray Tools for Blender by going to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Add-ons` > top left > `Install from disk`
* Install [OMF Editor](https://github.com/VaIeroK/Omf-Editor)

## Creating an animation

* Open your hands .blend file in Blender
* To start you need to have opened `Dope Sheet` editor and `Action Editor` in it
* If you need to use camera motion, follow the [Applying camera motion](#applying-camera-motion) section first
* Make an animation, you can find any other Blender tutorials on how to animate
* In the right side of the `Dope Sheet` editor, select `X-Ray` > `Export .skl`
  * Right panel can be hidden, you can show it by pressing `N` in that editor or select an arrow in the most right

### Applying camera motion

* In `3d Viewport` > `X-Ray` > `Add` > `Add X-Ray Camera` select `HUD SoC/CS`
* Select the camera in the `Outliner` editor
* With `File` > `Import` > `X-Ray Animation Path` import any .anm from `gamedata\anims\camera_effects`
* In the `Dope Sheet` editor select the imported camera animation
* Make sure the camera movement is playing
  * I noticed that when you are importing camera animation without selecting the camera, it will not work properly, so make sure you select the camera before importing (lol)
* Expand camera object `xray-camera-root` in the `Outliner` editor
* Select the `xray-camera` object
* In `Properties` editor go to `Data` > `Lens`
* Adjust FoV to your game settings (65 for the Gamma)

## Creating a *.omf file

### Preparing the scene

* Create new Blender project
* Import through `File` > `Import` > `X-Ray Game Object` any hands .ogf file, for example, any from `gamedata\meshes\anomaly_weapons\hands`
* Select the imported object
* In `Properties` editor go to `Data` > `Bone Collections` > `Add Bone Collection`
* In `3d Viewport` editor go to the `Pose Mode`
* Select all the bones in the `3d Viewport` editor
* In the `Bone Collections` select the newly created bone collection and click on `Assign Selected Bones`

### Exporting the *.omf file

* Import your .skl file(s) through `File` > `Import` > `X-Ray Skeletal Animation`
* In the `Dope Sheet` editor select and play your animation and make sure it works
* Export the animation through `Export` > `X-Ray Game Motion`
* Both SoC and CS/CoP formats worked for me and I haven't seen someone using `High Quality Motions` checkbox, so you can choose any of formats
* Select `Export Mode`
  * Overwrite - obvious
  * Add - adds the animation to the existing .omf file
    * This also can be done via `3d Viewport` > `X-Ray` > `OMF Editor` > `Merge OMF`

### Managing the *.omf file

* Open the OMF Editor
* Open your .omf file
* Refer to the [OMF Editor documentation](../../modding-tools/animations/omf-editor-by-valerok.md#about) for more information on how to use it
  * Usually you want to control [SDK Flags](../../modding-tools/animations/omf-editor-by-valerok.md#animation-options) for each specific animation

Follow [Script Animation Guide](../scripting/script-animations.md#motions-1) to learn how to use your animation in the game
