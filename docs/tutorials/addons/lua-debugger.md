Always up-to-date instruction on the Modded Exes repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith#script_debugger_instructions)

* Debug scripts with VSCode and LuaPanda, support by IX-Ray Platform
  * To use it, you need to install VSCode and [LuaPanda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stuartwang.luapanda) extension
  * Open your `gamedata/scripts` folder in VSCode
  * Download these files into your `gamedata/scripts/.vscode` folder:
    * [`launch.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/.vscode/launch.json)
    * [`settings.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/.vscode/settings.json)
  * Download these files into your `gamedata/scripts` folder:
    * [`LuaPanda.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/LuaPanda.lua)
    * [`dynamic_callbacks.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/dynamic_callbacks.lua)
    * [`global.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/global.lua)
    * [`socket.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/all-in-one-vs2022-wpo/gamedata/scripts/socket.lua)
  * In VSCode, go to `Run and Debug` section and start debugging or press F5 key
  * Return to the game and open in-game console with `~`
  * Type console command `lua_debug 1` in console and reload the save or start a new game
  * Type console command `run_string debugger_attach()`. If you do everything correctly and engine is working properly too, you will get an entry breakpoint at `global.lua` file in VSCode.
  * You have to re-enable the debugger every time you start a new game or load a save, so you have to type `run_string debugger_attach()` in console again.
  * Debugger is working dynamically, so you can add/remove files from your VSCode folder and it will automatically update the list of files available for debugging.
  * Debugger doesn't support workspace with multiple folders, so you HAVE to use "File" -> "Open Folder" to make debugger work
