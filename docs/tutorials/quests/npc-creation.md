All the code for this article is available in the [examples folder](https://github.com/Igigog/anomaly-modding-book/tree/main/examples/NPC%20Creation) of the repository

## Configuration

This guide uses [DLTX](../addons/dltx.md) heavily. I will assume some familiarity with DLTX concepts.

In this guide we'll create Barista - twin brother of Barkeep and love interest of Sidorovich. To keep it simple, we'll reuse most of the configuration of Barkeep.

What is stalker configuration:  
All dynamic objects are configured in `_unpacked\configs\system.ltx`.  
To not overcrowd the file, different configurations are grouped into multiple files, and they are included in system.ltx. Since we are using DLTX, we'll add our stuff to `system.ltx` directly.

What files to pay attention to:

- `_unpacked\configs\creatures\*`
- `_unpacked\configs\gameplay\*`
- `_unpacked\configs\misc\squad_descr\*`

### Creating your own mod files for character creation

While it's possible to configure the files already present, for independent addons it's advisable to create your own files. Here are the files you'll need (replace `my_mod_name` with a name of your choice, I'll be using `npcexample` in example files):

- `gamedata/configs/gameplay/character_desc_my_mod_name.xml`
- `gamedata/configs/gameplay/npc_profile_my_mod_name.xml`
- `gamedata/configs/misc/squad_descr/squad_descr_my_mod_name.ltx`
- `gamedata/configs/mod_system_my_mod_name.ltx`

At this point you will need to inject your files into the game. We will use DLTX. In `mod_system_my_mod_name.ltx` add:

```ini title="mod_system_my_mod_name.ltx"
![profiles]
>files = npc_profile_my_mod_name
>specific_characters_files = character_desc_my_mod_name
```

This will take care of both xml files. `mod_system_my_mod_name.ltx` will be used by DLTX automatically. `squad_descr_my_mod_name.ltx` is wildcard-included by `gamedata/configs/misc/squad_descr/squad_descr.ltx`, so that's nice. Done.

## NPC section

```ini title="_unpacked\configs\creatures\spawn_sections_bar.ltx"
[bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader]:stalker_silent
$spawn                      = "respawn\bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader"
character_profile           = bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader
story_id                    = bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader
```

This is an example of a section.

- `[bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader]:stalker_silent`  
  Refer to [LTX docs](../../references/configs/structure-of-files.md) to understand section definition and inheritance.

- `$spawn`  
  This on is not important, ignore.

- `character_profile`  
  You will later create a profile for the character in _unpacked\configs\gameplay\.

- `story_id`  
  Used for scripting. Instead of searching every object in the game to find this character, you can get him from story objects storage.

Now you make your section. Let's call your new character "han_yue_ling". Since all the spawn sections are included into `system.ltx`, we need to inject it there.

```ini title="gamedata/configs/mod_system_my_mod_name.ltx"
![profiles]
>files = npc_profile_npcexample
>specific_characters_files = character_desc_npcexample

[han_yue_ling]:stalker
character_profile           = han_yue_ling
story_id                    = han_yue_ling
```

I set it up to inherit "stalker" because I don't need the additional configuration in "stalker_silent" (see "stalker_silent" in `_unpacked\configs\creatures\spawn_sections_general.ltx`).

## NPC profile

```xml title="_unpacked\configs\gameplay\npc_profile_mlr.xml"
<!-- Bar -->
<character id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader">
  <class>bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader</class>
</character>
```

Very simple. Just make your NPC profile in a similar way.

```xml title="gamedata/configs/gameplay/npc_profile_my_mod_name.xml"
<?xml version='1.0' encoding="windows-1251"?>
<xml>

<character id="han_yue_ling">
    <class>han_yue_ling</class>
    <specific_character>han_yue_ling</specific_character>
</character>

</xml>
```

Now we create a character description.

```xml title="_unpacked\configs\gameplay\character_desc_bar.xml"
<!-- Barkeep -->
<specific_character id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader" team_default = "1">
	<name>bar_barmen_name</name>
	<icon>ui_inGame2_barman</icon>
	<map_icon x="1" y="4"></map_icon>
	<bio>bar_barmen_bio</bio>
	<class>bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader</class>
	<community>trader</community>
	<terrain_sect>stalker_terrain</terrain_sect>
	<money min="1000000" max="1000000" infinitive="1"></money>
	<rank>18490</rank>
	<reputation>2408</reputation>
	<visual>actors\barman\barman</visual>
	<!-- <snd_config>characters_voice\human\stalker_1\</snd_config> -->
	<crouch_type>-1</crouch_type>
	<supplies></supplies>
	<start_dialog>bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_start_dialog</start_dialog>
	<actor_dialog>dm_init_batender</actor_dialog>
	<!-- LTTZ -->
	<actor_dialog>barkeep_living_legend</actor_dialog>
	<actor_dialog>barkeep_100rads</actor_dialog>
	...
</specific_character>
```

- `<specific_character id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader" team_default = "1">`  
  Character description id.

- `<name>bar_barmen_name</name>`  
  Stalker name. The game will try to map this id with the strings in `_unpacked\configs\text\*`.

- `<icon>ui_inGame2_barman</icon>`  
  Same as `<name></name>` but in `_unpacked\configs\ui\textures_descr\*`.

- `<bio>bar_barmen_bio</bio>`  
  Not important. Can just leave it `<bio></bio>`.

- `<class>bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader</class>`  
  Character profile. Not to confuse with character description.  
  Multiple character descriptions can be linked to one character profile.  
  When a stalker is spawned, it will randomly pick one of the character descriptions.  
  So although they are the same "stalker_level_4" they have different names, icons, models, voices.

- `<community>trader</community>`  
  Faction. dolg,freedom,stalker,army, etc.

- `<terrain_sect>stalker_terrain</terrain_sect>`  
  Not important. Just keep it as is.

- `<visual>actors\barman\barman</visual>`  
  Stalker model.

- `<crouch_type>-1</crouch_type>`  
  No idea. Maybe it's because Barman has unique animations? I don't create this line in my character description.

- `<supplies></supplies>`  
  Items that are guaranteed to be given to the stalker when he is spawned.

- `<start_dialog>bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_start_dialog</start_dialog>`  
  Stalkers will speak this dialog when initiating dialog.

- `<actor_dialog>dm_init_batender</actor_dialog>`  
  One of the dialog options that actor can choose after `<start_dialog></start_dialog>`.

So we make our character description like this.

```xml title="gamedata/configs/gameplay/character_desc_my_mod_name.xml"
<?xml version='1.0' encoding="windows-1251"?>
<xml>

<specific_character id="han_yue_ling" team_default = "1">
    <name>han_yue_ling_name</name>
    <icon>ui_inGame2_barman</icon>
    <map_icon x="1" y="4"></map_icon>
    <bio></bio>
    <class>han_yue_ling</class>
    <community>dolg</community>
    <terrain_sect>stalker_terrain</terrain_sect>
    <money min="1000000" max="1000000" infinitive="1"></money>
    <rank>18490</rank>
    <reputation>2408</reputation>
    <visual>actors\barman\barman</visual>
    <snd_config>characters_voice\human\stalker_1\</snd_config>
    <supplies></supplies>
</specific_character>

</xml>

```

## Squad and smart terrain

You don't spawn a stalker object alone. Stalkers and monsters always come with squads. Even when there is only one NPC, you still have to put him in a squad.

Squad configuration is in `_unpacked\configs\misc\squad_descr\*`.

```ini title="_unpacked\configs\misc\squad_descr\squad_descr_bar.xml"
[bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_squad]:online_offline_group
faction                     = stalker
npc                         = bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader
target_smart                = bar_visitors
spawn_point                 = bar_barman_spawn
story_id                    = bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_squad
always_arrived              = true
```

- `npc = bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader`  
  NPCs that are guaranteed to be spawned in the squad. You put object section here.

- `target_smart = bar_visitors`  
  The squad will try to reach this smart terrain and will stay here forever. Can use a condlist to change target.

- `spawn_point = bar_barman_spawn`  
  Where squad members appear when they are online. I don't find it useful so never use it.

- `always_arrived = true`  
  I don't know, never use it.

So we make our squad:

```ini title="gamedata/configs/misc/squad_descr/squad_descr_my_mod_name.ltx"
[han_yue_ling_squad]:online_offline_group
faction                     = dolg
npc                         = han_yue_ling
target_smart                = bar_dolg_general
story_id                    = han_yue_ling_squad
```

You can always find smart terrain name in here: `_unpacked\configs\scripts\<level name>\smart\<smart terrain name>`. Or just use debug menu for that.

___

## Spawn

There are two ways to spawn your NPC : by script, or by adding your NPC to the correct smart terrain in `simulation.ltx`.

### Spawn by script

Make a new file in `gamedata\scripts\` like this:

```lua title="_unpacked\scripts\han_yue_ling.script"
-- Bind function actor_on_first_update() to callback "actor_on_first_update"
function on_game_start()
  RegisterScriptCallback("actor_on_first_update",spawn_han_yue_ling)
end

function spawn_han_yue_ling()
	-- Check if having info "han_yue_ling_init"
	if not has_alife_info("han_yue_ling_init") then
		-- Check if squad does not exist.
		if not get_story_se_object("han_yue_ling_squad") then
			-- Get smart terrain "bar_dolg_general"
			local smart = SIMBOARD.smarts_by_names["bar_dolg_general"]
			-- Spawn squad "han_yue_ling_squad"
			local squad = SIMBOARD:create_squad(smart,"han_yue_ling_squad")
		end
		-- Check if squad exist (spawned successfully).
		if get_story_se_object("han_yue_ling_squad") then
			-- Give info so the game won't spawn another squad every time loading a save file.
			give_info("han_yue_ling_init")
		end
	end
end
```

Start a new game or load your save files and the npc will be spawned and stay around the campfire in duty headquarters yard.

If you have multiple spawns of the same NPC, make sure that you gave the squad a story ID - the script checks for this story ID and if it can't find the ID it will spawn endlessly the same NPC.

### Spawn by adding to simulation.ltx

Locate the file `simulation.ltx`, in `_unpacked\configs\misc\`. Inside of that file, you can locate the smart terrain where you want your NPC to spawn, and add your NPC to the list.

```ini title="_unpacked\configs\misc\simulation.ltx"
...
[bar_dolg_general]
bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_squad
bar_dolg_general_zoneguard_stalker_squad
duty_sim_squad_advanced                 = 1
duty_sim_squad_novice                   = 1
duty_sim_squad_veteran                  = 1
dolg_medic_squad
han_yue_ling_squad                      ; add your NPC to the list

...
```

Note that this method of spawning the NPC will not force the NPC to stay there, and you might need a script, or a logic scheme to force the NPC to stay at that smart terrain.

I will make more advanced guides if there are enough modders who are interested.
