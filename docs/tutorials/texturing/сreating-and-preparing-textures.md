## Beginning (Via Paint.net)

First, familiarize yourself with the supported texture compression ([*.dds](../../reference/file-formats/textures/dds.md) [*_bump.dds](../../reference/file-formats/textures/bump.md) [*_bump#.dds](../../reference/file-formats/textures/bump_hash.md))

## Start

First we have to create a texture, or we have to download one.
Next, we need to convert our texture into [*.dds](../../reference/file-formats/textures/dds.md) format.
To do this, you can use any program of yours that can do such a thing. (or you can take a program from [this](../../modding-tools/README.md) list)

The most commonly used program for this is Paint.net. We download the texture and save it as [*.dds](../../reference/file-formats/textures/dds.md).
The Save Settings window appears.

We have to choose the texture compression that suits us.

Save our texture.
