# Main Folders And Files

___

## About

This guide describes the purpose of key folders and files.

## Root files and folders

Files and folders located in the main game directory.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File / Folder</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>fsgame.ltx</td>
      <td>
        The main configuration file that defines the paths to critical resource folders.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>bin</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>db</td>
      <td>
        Contains packaged game resources in archives. Has a lower priority than the gamedata folder. If the file exists in gamedata, the game will use it instead of the version from *.db.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gamedata</td>
      <td>
        The game primarily searches for resources here. If the folder is missing, data from the *.db is used. The structure of its subfolders mirrors the structure of the archives.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tools</td>
      <td>
        Contains auxiliary tools for modding: icons for add-ons, resource converters, *.bat files for unpacking .db archives.
