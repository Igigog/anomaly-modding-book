# Set Joint Limits Operator

___

## About

Operators from this group are needed to set limits for bones with Joint type. They are available in Pose Mode if there is an active bone. Limits are set only for the active bone. Limit values coincide with the transformations in the 3D Viewport of the active bone in Pose Mode. To visualize the limits and current transformations, you can enable the Display Bone Limits parameter at the armature. Operators that set such limits are available:

### Min X Operator
