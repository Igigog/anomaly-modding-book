## Using authors in documentation and blogs

### Blog

In the front matter of your blog's Markdown files, you can reference authors as follows:

```yml
---
authors: [johndoe, janesmith]
---
```

### Docs

For docs pages, the format changes:

```html
<Authors
  authors={["johndoe", "janesmith"]}
  size="medium"
  showTitle={true}
  showDescription={true}
/>
```
