Due to internal changes and limitations of the previous platform on which the book was written, it was decided to move to a new platform that would offer more options in terms of page configuration and application appearance. The website domain was also changed. Previously, the book was located on the personal GitHub of the founder, Igi, but since he stepped down, the site was moved to a permanent new domain. I sincerely hope that all these changes with the platform and domain change are the last ones and that there will be no more such major changes. At this time, some articles may be empty or broken. Please report this on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8Pu2ekQYg3) or open an [Issue](https://github.com/TheParaziT/anomaly-modding-book/issues) in GitHub.

Anomaly Modding Book is still alive and growing.
